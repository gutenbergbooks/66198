<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>THE ENGLISH, IRISH, AND SCOTCH KNIGHTS OF
THE ORDER OF ST. JOHN OF JERUSALEM.</h3>

<p>For the following list of the English, Irish, and
Scotch knights of the Order of St. John, who are
mentioned in the records of this island when
under its rule, I am in a great measure indebted
to Dr. Vella, who, after having made at my request
a diligent search through very many old
volumes and manuscripts, has kindly favoured me
with the result of his labours. The names of the
knights and places mentioned in this Note are
written, in every instance, as Dr. Vella and myself
have seen them recorded. Before commencing
with the list, I have a few remarks to offer,
that the terms peculiar to the Order which I shall
make use of may be understood by those of your
readers who are unacquainted with its history.</p>

<p>The English tongue comprised the priories of
England, Ireland, and Scotland, and thirty-two
different commanderies. Its property, which was
seized by Henry VIII. in 1534, was afterwards
restored by Queen Mary, and finally and effectually
confiscated by Elizabeth in the first year
of her reign. Her Majesty's order for the seizure
of the Irish estates was dated on the 3rd of June,
1559, and addressed to William Fitzwilliam.
Vide the "Diplomatic Code of the Order," and
Rymer, vol. xv. p. 527.</p>

<p>Although Dr. Vella and myself had every wish
to classify the knights of the English tongue
under their different languages, still we have
failed in our first attempt, and to enable us to
succeed we must ask for assistance from your correspondents
in England. They must be known
by their names; thus, for instance, the Dundas's of
1524 and 1538 were as evidently of Scotch, as the
Russells of 1536, 1537, and 1554 were of English
descent. We might apply the same remark to
many other knights whose names will be found
recorded in the following list.</p>

<p>Whenever a vacancy occurred by the death of
a grand master, who was always a sovereign
prince, the election for his successor could only
take place in the convent. It was not necessary that
the person elected should be present. Villiers De<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>{190}</span>
L'Isle Adam was residing in France in 1521, when
his brethren at Rhodes made him their chief. The
grand priors, commanders, and knights, who were
absent from Malta, whether employed in the
service of the Order or not, had neither voice nor
ballot in the election; and the more effectually to
prevent their interference, as also that of the
Roman pontiff, only three days were allowed to
transpire before a successor was chosen, and proclaimed
as the head of the convent.</p>

<p>Henry VIII. addressed L'Isle Adam as follows:
"Reverendissimo in Christo Patri Domini, F. de
Villers L. Isleadam, Magno Hierosolymitani Ordinis
Magistro, et consanguineo, et amico nostro
carissimo." George II., as the king of a Protestant
country, sent a letter to Emmanuel Pinto, bearing
the following superscription: "Eminentissimo
Principi Domino Emanueli Pinto, Magno Ordinis
Melitensis Magistro, Consanguineo, et Amico
Nostro Carissimo."</p>

<p>Boisgelin has stated in the first volume of his
<i>History of Malta</i>, p. 194., that the&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"King of England addressed the grand master by
the following titles: 'Eminentissime princeps consanguinea
et amice noster carissime.' The King of
France gave the Order the title of 'Très chers et bons
amis;' and the grand master that of 'Très cher et très
aimé cousin," in the same style as he addressed the
Dukes of Tuscany."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That this note may not occupy too much space
in your interesting, publication, I would now
merely remark that the "convent" was known as
the place where the grand master, or his lieutenant,
resided, and the "tongue," according to the
code of the Order, was the term applied to a
nation. A grand prior was the chief of his language,
who resided in his native country. A
"Turcopolier" was the title of the conventual
bailiff of the venerable language of England, "and
it took its name from the Turcopoles, a sort of
light horse mentioned in the history of the wars
carried on by the Christians in Palestine." The
English knights won for themselves this high
honour by their gallantry in the Holy Land, and
in remembrance it ever after remained with their
tongue. A Turcopolier was the third dignity in
the convent, and the last knight who enjoyed it
was Sir Richard Shelley, Prior of England. At
his decease the grand master assumed the title for
himself. The two interesting letters addressed
by Sir Richard Shelley to Henry VIII., in which
he complained of his majesty's treatment to the
Order of St. John, and pleaded in its favour, were
published in the English language, and five years
ago were to be seen in the government library of
this island. But, on my asking a short time ago to
refer to them, I regretted to find that they had
been taken from the library by a <i>gentleman</i> who
was well introduced to the librarian, and whose
conduct in this, and some other transactions where
valuable books are concerned, cannot be too
strongly condemned. Before returning from this
brief digression to the subject of my Note, might
I ask if these letters are known in England, and
whether copies could be easily procured for a
friend who is desirous of having them inserted in
a forthcoming publication?</p>

<p>The Knights of St. John being members of a
masonic institution, termed each other brothers,
is customary with members of the craft at the
present time. And it may not be out of place to
remark that several of the chapels, churches, and
fortifications of Malta are ornamented with masonic
signs and emblems, which have been several
times referred to, and cleverly explained within
the last three years in different numbers of the
<i>Masonic Quarterly Review</i>. Those of your
readers who take an interest in masonry may
peruse these papers of a distinguished mason, now
stationed in the West Indies, with instruction and
pleasure.</p>

<p>Boisgelin has recorded in the first volume of his
<i>History of Malta</i>, p. 182., that the Order of St.
John of Jerusalem "might with propriety be considered
as being at the same time hospitaller, religious,
military, republican, aristocratical, monarchical,"
and lastly, as if these different terms,
which, without his explanation, would appear to
be incorrect as applying to one institution, were
not sufficient, he has added in a note, that in the
last days of its existence it might also have been
called democratical. He has stated that it was&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Hospitaller, from having hospitals constantly open
for the reception of the sick of all countries and religions,
whom the knights attended in person. Religious,
because the members took the three vows of
chastity, obedience, and poverty, which last consisted
in having no property independent of the Order at
large, and on that account the Pope was their superior.
Military, from being constantly armed, and always at
war with the infidels. Republican, as their chief was
chosen from among themselves, and could not enact
laws, or carry them into execution, without their consent.
Aristocratical, since none but the knights and
grand master had any share in the legislative and executive
power. Monarchical, from having a superior
who could not be dispossessed of his dignity, and was
invested with the right of sovereignty over the subjects
of the order, together with those of Malta and its dependencies.
And lastly, Democratical, from the introduction
of a language which did not require any
proofs of nobility."<a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Before taking leave of Boisgelin, it should be
recorded that he was a Knight of Malta; and his
history, one of the best now extant, appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>{191}</span>
those troubled times, when he hoped by conciliating
all governments, to see his Order again restored.
Influenced in all things by this hope,
vain as it was, his statements should be received
with some grains of allowance.</p>

<p>Before calling attention to the following list, I
have to state that a knight could not become
commander before he had made four cruises in
the galleys, or served five years in the convent.
He had also to remain three years a commander
before he could claim a pension. Those knights
who are known to have been at Malta will be distinguished
by a †.</p>

<h3>DUPORT'S LINES TO IZAAK WALTON.</h3>

<p>Sometime since I met with the following epigrams
of the learned scholar, divine, and loyalist James
Duport, written on the fly-leaf of a copy of his <i>Musæ
Subsecivæ, seu Poetica Stromata</i>, presented by him
to Izaak Walton. I presume that they have never
been printed, and that they were written in Duport's
own hand. If so, they may be thought worthy of
a place in the columns of "N. &amp; Q." They will
be read with some interest by those who respect
Duport, and love the memory of good old Izaak
Walton. I may add, that the autograph of I. W.
is in the book, thus:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Besides these four emendations, which at any
rate are very suggestive of those in Mr. Collier's
folio, I beg to call attention to Jackson's defence
of Theobald's (and his own) proposition to read
<i>untread</i> for <i>unthread</i>, in <i>King John</i>, Act V. Sc. 4.,
which is strikingly like Mr. Collier's defence of
the same reading in the margin of the Folio 1632.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>{194}</span>
The whole of Jackson's notes on <i>King John</i> are
well worth reading. I beg to mention two of
these, as illustrations of old Jackson's acuteness,
when not under the warping influence of the <i>cacoëthes
emendandi</i>. His defence of <i>untrimmed
bride</i>, in Act II. Sc. 1., is most convincing. He
says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Constance stimulates [Lewis] to stand fast to his
purpose, and not to let the devil tempt him, in the likeness
of an <i>untrimmed</i> bride, to waver in his determination;
for that the influence of the Holy See would
strip King John of his present royalty. Where then
would be the great dowry Lewis was to receive with
his wife? At present he has only the <i>promise</i> of five
provinces, and 30,000 marks of English coin; therefore
as the dowry has not been paid, Blanche is still
an <i>untrimmed</i> bride."&mdash;<i>Recollections and Illustrations</i>,
p. 179.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>His note on the use of <i>invisible</i>, in Act V. Sc. 7.,
is also excellent:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Death having prayed upon the reduced body of the
king, quits it, and now <i>invisible</i>, has laid siege to the
mind."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have elsewhere stated my opinion that "all
Jackson's emendations are bad." I should have
added that some few are very plausible and specious,
and worthy of consideration. I will mention
one in <i>King John</i>, Act IV. Sc. 2. Pembroke
says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"If, what <i>in rest</i> you have, in right you hold," &amp;c.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now, <i>rest</i> and <i>right</i> are no antithesis, nor are they
allied in meaning. Jackson inserts a <i>t'</i> between <i>in</i>
and <i>rest</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"If, what <i>int'rest</i> you have in right you hold," &amp;c.&mdash;</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>which he supports by admirable parallels from the
same play. I will cite one more example of Jackson's
sagacity, from his notes on <i>1 Henry IV.</i>, Act I.
Sc. 3. Hotspur says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Never did <i>bare and</i> rotten policy," &amp;c.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Jackson reads,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Never did <i>barren</i> rotten policy," &amp;c.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Collier never once refers to Jackson. Mr.
Singer, however, talks familiarly about Jackson,
in his <i>Shakspeare Vindicated</i>, as if he had him at
his fingers' ends; and yet, at page 239., he favours
the world with an <i>original</i> emendation (viz. "He
did <i>behood</i> his anger," <i>Timon</i>, Act III. Sc. 1.),
which, however, will be found at page 389. of
Jackson's book. I may be in error, but I cannot
but think such ignorance, on the part of professional
Shakspearians, very culpable.</p>

<p><i>On Three Passages in "Measure for Measure."</i>&mdash;I
have to crave a small space in your columns,
which have already done much good service for
the text of Shakspeare, to make a very few remarks
on three passages in the play of <i>Measure
for Measure</i>. It is no sweeping change of reading
that I am about to advocate, nor, as I think, anything
over ingenious; inasmuch as, in two of the
passages in question, I propose to defend the
reading of the first folio, which, I contend, has
been departed from unnecessarily; while, in the
third, I suggest the simple change of an <i>f</i> into
an <i>s</i>.</p>

<p>In Act II. Sc. 4., these lines occur in Angelo's
soliloquy, in my folio of 1623:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="i4">"The state whereon I studied</p>
    <p>Is like a good thing, being often read,</p>
    <p>Growne feard and tedious."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Knight, and other editors, read <i>feard</i>, as in
the original, but give no explanation; though such
a strange epithet would seem to require one. I
propose to read <i>seared</i>, <i>i.e.</i> dry, the opposite of
fresh. This, as the saying is, "requires," I think,
"only to be pointed out to be admitted."</p>

<p>Lower down in the same scene we find the
following passage, in one of Angelo's addresses to
Isabel:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="i8">"Such a person,</p>
    <p>Whose creadit with the judge, or owne great place,</p>
    <p>Could fetch your brother from the manacles</p>
    <p>Of the all-building law."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The word <i>building</i> has always been a stumbling-block
to editors. Johnson first proposed to read
<i>binding</i>, and his successors have adopted it, and
such is now the generally received reading. Mr.
Collier's old corrector is also in favour of the
same change. I have always felt convinced, however,
that <i>building</i> was the word which Shakspeare
wrote. That which answers to it in the A.-S. is
<i>bytling</i>, <i>bytleing</i>, a building; <i>bytlian</i>, to build;
which are inflected from <i>byth</i>, <i>biotul</i>, a hammer or
mallet (whence our <i>beetle</i>); so that the strict
meaning of the verb is <i>firmare</i>, <i>confirmare</i>, to
fasten, close, or bind together. This will give
much the same meaning to <i>building</i> as that implied
in the proposed substitute <i>binding</i>.</p>

<p>Not having met with the word used in this
peculiar sense by any old writer, I could not
venture to maintain the reading of the folio on
these grounds, which I have just mentioned, alone.
At length, however, I have been successful, and I
am now able to quote a passage from a work
published very shortly before this play, entitled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Jewel House of Art and Nature", &amp;c., "faithfully
and familiarly set downe according to the
Author's owne experience, by Hugh Platte, of Lincoln's
Inne, gentleman. London, 1594."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>in which this word <i>building</i> is used in precisely
the same sense as that which I defend. In "the
Preface of the Author," the following passage
occurs:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I made a condicionall promise of some farther discouerie
in arteficiall conceipts, then either my health<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>{195}</span>
or leisure would then permit: I am now resolued
(notwithstanding the vnkind acceptation of my first
fruits, which then I feared and hath since falne out, is
a sufficient release in law of the condition) to make the
same in some sort absolute (though not altogether
according to the fulnesse of my first purpose), and to become
a <i>building</i> word unto me."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I apprehend that this parallel instance is all
that is wanting to preserve, for the future, the
reading of the first folio unimpaired.</p>

<p>The third passage on which I have a remark to
offer, is that much tormented one in Act III.
Sc. 1., which stands in my first folio thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"<i>Cla.</i> The prenzie, Angelo?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <p><i>Isa.</i> Oh, 'tis the cunning liuerie of hell,</p>
    <p>The damnest bodie to inuest, and couer</p>
    <p>In prenzie gardes."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I need not say a word about the various suggestions
of <i>primzie</i>, <i>priestly</i>, <i>princely</i>, <i>precise</i>, &amp;c.,
which have appeared from time to time; my
business is solely with the original word in the
first folio. I have always felt sure that this is
none other than the poet's own word, and no error
of the printer; for how could it be possible to
make a gross mistake in a word which occurs
twice within four lines, and one, moreover, so unusual;
the printer must surely have been able to
decipher the letters from <i>one</i> of the two written
specimens. It will be observed that there is a
comma after <i>prenzie</i> in the original, indicating
that the word is a substantive, not an adjective.
Now what is the Italian for a prince? Not only
<i>principe</i>, but also <i>prenze</i>; and in like manner we
find <i>principessa</i> and <i>prenzessa</i>. I have no doubt
that what Shakspeare <i>did</i> write was&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"The prenzie, Angelo?"</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>while a little lower down he converted the word
into an adjective:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="i4">"To inuest and couer</p>
    <p>In prenzie gardes."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It is obvious to remark that this meaning of
<i>prenzie</i> exactly fits the sense: Angelo was a prince,
and he was clad in robes of office, adorned with
princely "gardes," or trappings. Shakspeare, no
doubt, was very well acquainted with Italian
tales and poems; the word may have become
quite familiar to him. His intention here, in putting
the term in question into Claudio's mouth,
may have been to give an Italian character to the
scene, introducing thus the <i>local term of dignity</i> of
the deputy; thus recalling the audience, by the
occurrence of a single word, to the scene of the
plot; for though this is said to be in Vienna, yet
it is to be observed that not a name throughout
the play is German, <i>everything is Italian</i>. And
let it not be objected that the use of this word
involves an obscurity which Shakspeare would
have avoided; we are hardly able to judge, now-a-days,
whether a particular word was obscure or
not in his time: at all events, there would be no
difficulty in adducing instances of what we should
call more obscure allusions, and I think there can
be little doubt that the well-educated in those
days well understood the Italian <i>prenze</i> to mean a
prince.</p>

<p><i>Sincere.</i>&mdash;Trench, <i>On the Study of Words</i>, 4th

as the best and finest honey should be."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>{196}</span></p>

<p>Is not this derivation erroneous? <i>Sincere</i> does
not mean "pure, like virgin-honey;" but it expresses
the absence of deception. I doubt not
that it is derived from&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The practice of Roman potters to rub wax into the
flaws of their unsound vessels when they sent them to
market. A sincere [without wax] vessel was the same
as a sound vessel, one that had no disguised flaw."</p>

derivation is no novelty. I reproduce it merely

<h3>THE CRESCENT.</h3>

<p>I shall be obliged to any correspondent of
"N. &amp; Q." who will point out the period at
which the crescent became the standard of
Mahometanism. Poets and romancers freely bestow
it upon any time or scene in which Mussulmans
are introduced; Sir Walter Scott mentions it
in the <i>Talisman</i>, but after the strange liberties
he has taken with Saladin and Richard, he becomes,
on such a question, no higher authority
than writers of meaner name. I cannot find it in
the history of Mahomet, or in that of his immediate
successors. The first time Michaud, in his
fine <i>Histoire des Croisades</i>, speaks of it is in the
reign of Mahomet II., which is many centuries
after periods at which modern poets, and even
historians, have named it as the antagonistic
standard to the cross. The crescent is common
upon the reverses of coins of the Eastern empire
long before the Turkish conquest, and was, I have
reason to believe, in some degree peculiar to the
Sclave nations. Was it the standard of the Turks,
as contradistinguished from other Saracens? or,
was it adopted by Mahomet II. after his conquests
of Constantinople and the eastern countries of
Europe? I am aware that if this last idea be
substantiated, it will make it much more modern
than it is generally supposed to be, but our ideas
of everything, Turkish were for so long a time
mixed with the wonderful and the romantic, that
we must not expect much correctness on such
points. The Turks came into fearful contiguity
with the West in the fifteenth century; Europe
had as much to dread from them then as from the
Russians now. This event and the art of printing
were almost cotemporary, and the crescent has
been presented to us as the symbol of Mahometanism
ever since; but I much doubt it can be
proved to have been so at a far remoter period.</p>

<p><i>Flemish Refugees.</i>&mdash;In the troubled times of
the Reformation, England was not seldom the
refuge for Flemings who, for the sake of religion,
abandoned their country. Among these was Mr.
Joos Tuck, who, according to a consistorial decision
of Dec. 14, 1582, was proposed by G. Van
Den Haute, then pastor at Sluis, to the brethren
of the Flemish Class, since "they had taken knowledge
of the sound and good gifts of their brother."
He left Sluis soon after, probably in July, 1583,
and withdrew to England. I should be glad to
learn what befell him there.</p>

<p>Peter Lambert was a student of the University
of Ghent: though, as far as I am aware, he is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>{197}</span>
mentioned in Te Water's <i>History of the Reformed
Church and University in Ghent</i>. On July 21,
1583, a student made known his wish to propose
himself as candidate for the ministry; and on
August 4 appeared Peter Lambert, student of
the University of Ghent, before the consistory,
requesting the brethren to grant him the twenty-five
guilders which had been promised; because,
on account of the troubled state of the country,
he wished to flee to England, on which request
was decided: "Since a well-known and pious
brother, who is compelled to flee, is in need of
help, let the deacons and <i>pensionary</i> of the town
be addressed thereon." Very probably, therefore,
he also took refuge in England. Can any one give

<p><i>Attainment of Majority.</i>&mdash;Professor <span class="sc">De Morgan</span>
will, I am sure, permit me to put this question to
him:</p>

<p>In a short treatise "On Ancient and Modern
Usage in Reckoning," written by him for the
<i>Companion to the Almanac</i> of 1850, he explains, at
page 9., the usage of attainment of majority in
these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nevertheless in the law, which here preserves <i>the
old reckoning</i>, he is of full age on the 9th: though he
were born on the 10th, he is of age to execute a
settlement <i>a minute after midnight</i> on the morning of
the 9th."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I want to have this statement reconciled with the
opening scene of Ben Jonson's <i>Staple of News</i>,
where Pennyboy jun. counts, as his watch strikes&mdash;"one,
two, three, four, five, six!"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">

<p>Then "the fashioner" comes in to fit on the heir's
new clothes; he had "waited below 'till the clock
struck," and gives, as an excuse, "your worship
might have pleaded <i>nonage</i>, if you had got 'em
on ere I could make just affidavit of the time."</p>

<p>All these particulars are too <i>verbatim</i> to admit
of doubt as to the peculiar usage of that time; and
from other sources I know that Ben Jonson was
right: but it is not alluded to in the treatise first
mentioned, nor is it stated when the usage was
altered to "a minute after midnight."</p>

<p><i>Hartman's Account of Waterloo.</i>&mdash;In the note

Lord Byron says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The place where Major Howard fell was not far
from two tall and solitary trees, which stand a few
yards from each other at a pathway's side. Beneath

<h3>BEE-PARK&mdash;BEE-HALL.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. v., pp. 322. 498.)</p>

<p>Enjoying as we do the advantages of the extension
of scientific knowledge, and its application
to our routine of daily wants, we are apt to forget
that our forefathers were without many things we
deem essentials. Your correspondents C. W. G.
and B. B. have touched upon a curious feature of
antiquity, which science and commerce have rendered
obsolete. Yet, before the introduction of
sugar, bees were important ministers to the luxuries
of the great, as mentioned at the above-cited
pages. I was struck with the following passage in
the first forest charter of King Henry III.:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Every freeman ... shall likewise have the
honey which shall be found in his woods."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This, in a charter second only in importance,
perhaps, to Magna Charta itself, sounds strange to
our ideas; moderns would not think it a very
royal boon. But the note with which Mr. R.
Thomson (<i>Historical Essay on the Magna Charta
of King John</i>, p. 352.) illustrates this passage is
interesting, and, though rather long, may be worth
insertion in your columns:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The second part of this chapter secures to the
woodland proprietor all the honey found in his woods;
which was certainly a much more important gift than
it would at first appear, since the Hon. Daines Barrington
remarks, that perhaps there has been no lawsuit
or question concerning it for the last three hundred
years. In the middle ages, however, the use
of honey was very extensive in England, as sugar was
not brought hither until the fifteenth century; and it
was not only a general substitute for it in preserving,
but many of the more luxurious beverages were principally
composed of it, as mead, metheglin, pigment,
and morat, and these were famous from the Saxon days,
down even to the time of the present charter (1217).
In the old Danish and Swedish laws bees form a principal
subject; and honey was a considerable article of
rent in Poland, in which it was a custom to bind any
one who stole it to the tree whence it was taken. The
Baron de Mayerberg also relates, that when he travelled
in Muscovy in 1661, he saw trees there expressly
adapted to receive bees, which even those who
felled their own wood were enjoined to take down in
such a manner that they who prepared them should have
the benefit of the honey. Nor was the wax of less importance
to the woodland proprietors of England, since
candles of tallow are said to have been first used only
in 1290, and those of wax were so great a luxury, that
in some places they were unknown: but a statute concerning
wax-chandlers, passed in 1433 (the 11th of
Henry VI. chap. 12.), states that wax was then used
in great quantities for the images of saints. Only referring,
however, to the well-known use of large wax
tapers by King Alfred in the close of the ninth century,
it may be observed that in the laws of Hoel Dha,
king of South Wales, which are acknowledged as authentic
historical documents, made about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 940, of
much older materials, is mentioned the right of the
king's chamberlain to as much wax as he could bite
from the end of a taper."&mdash;<i>Coke</i>; <i>Manwood</i>; <i>Barrington</i>;
<i>Statutes of the Realm</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you will allow a few words more in
illustration of B. B.'s Query (Vol. v., p. 498.).
A recent correspondent, writing of some modern
experiments on the venom of toads, suggests the
propriety of contributing to a list of "vulgar
errors" which have proved to be "vulgar truths."
It would not much surprise me to learn that, after
all, the popular belief in the efficacy of the rough
music of the key and warming-pan might be
added to his list. At all events the reason stated
by B. B. to prove its uselessness, viz. that bees
have no sense of hearing, must, I think, be
abandoned, as a Query of <span class="sc">Mr. Sydney Smirke</span>
(Vol. vii., p. 499.), and an answer (Vol. vii.,
p. 633.), will show. That all insects are possessed
of hearing, naturalists seem now as well convinced
of as that they have eyes; though some naturalists
formerly considered they were not, as Linnæus
and Bonnet; while Huber (his interesting observations
on bees notwithstanding) seems to have
been quite undecided on the point. Bees, as well
as all other insects, hear through the medium of
their antennæ, which in a subordinate degree are
used as feelers; observing which, perhaps, Huber
and others were indisposed to ascribe to them the
sense in question.</p>

<p>In reference to <span class="sc">Mr. Sydney Smirke's</span> Query,
so far from other naturalists confirming Huber's
observations as to the effect produced by the sound
emitted by the <i>Sphynx atropos</i> on the bees, besides
Dr. Bevan (quoted Vol. vii., p. 633.), the
intelligent entomologist, Mr. Duncan, author of the
entomological portion of <i>The Naturalist's Library</i>
(vol. xxxiv. pp. 53-55.), completely disproves
them. He tells us that he has closely watched
bees, and has seen the queen attack the larva cells;
but the sentinels, notwithstanding the reiteration
of the queenly sound, so far from remaining motionless,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>{200}</span>
held their sovereign in check, and stubbornly
persisted in the defence of their charge
against the attacks of their queen and mother.
Besides this disproval of the incapacitation of bees
by the emission of a sound, another from the experiments
of Huber himself may be mentioned.
He introduced a <i>Sphynx atropos</i> into a hive in the
daytime, and it was immediately attacked and
killed by the workers. Query, Might not the
explanation of the robbery of hives by this moth
be, that the darkness of night incapacitates the
bees, while it is the time nature has provided for
the wanderings of the <i>Sphynx</i>?</p>

<h3>MILTON'S WIDOW.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. vii., p. 596.; Vol. viii., pp. 12. 134.)</p>

<p>A contribution of mine to the miscellaneous vol.
of the Chetham Society's publications having been
introduced to your readers by the handsome notice
of <span class="sc">Mr. Hughes</span>, I feel bound to notice the objection
raised by your correspondent <span class="sc">Garlichithe</span>
(Vol. viii., p. 134.), who has confounded Randle the
<i>grandfather</i> and Randle the <i>son</i> of the writer of
these letters quoted by Mr. Hunter. Richard Minshull,
who was the writer of these letters in 1656,
and died in the following year, had several sons,
of whom the eldest, Randle, correctly described
by <span class="sc">Mr. Hughes</span> as the great-great-grandson of
the Minshull who first settled at Wistaston, had
seven children, of whom Elizabeth, the widow
of Milton, was one. She was baptized at Wistaston
on the 30th Dec. 1638. In 1680 (about six years
after her husband's death), by means of a family
arrangement with Richard Minshull of Wistaston,
frame-work knitter, who, there can be little doubt,
was her brother, evidenced by a bond in my possession,
she acquired a leasehold interest in a farm
at Brindley, near Nantwich. On the 20th July,
1720, by her name and description of Elizabeth
Milton, of Nantwich, widow, she administered to
the effects of her brother, John Minshull, in the
Consistory Court of Chester; and her will, the
probate of which is also in my possession, is dated
22nd August, and proved 10th October, 1727. <span class="sc">Mr.
Hughes</span> having given a reference to the volume
where this information will be found in detail, a
reference to it might have saved <span class="sc">Garlichithe</span>
the trouble of starting an objection, and shown
him that, so far from the facts stated being irreconcilable
with Mr. Hunter's tract, that gentleman's
reference to Randle Holme's <i>Correspondence</i>
was suggested by a communication of my own to
<i>The Athenæum</i>, and in its turn furnished me with
the clue from which I eventually ascertained the
particulars of Mrs. Milton's birth and parentage.
I am sorry to say that I have wholly failed in
finding the register of her marriage: it is not in
the register-book of her native place. It might
be worth while to search the register of the
parishes in which Milton's residence in Jewin
Street, and Dr. Paget's in Coleman Street, are
situate. There is no uncertainty as to the date,
which Aubrey tells us was in "the yeare before
the sicknesse."</p>

<p>Though <span class="sc">Cranmore</span> (Vol. v., p. 327.) is said to be
a deserter from the ranks of "N. &amp; Q.," I hope he
is known to some of your readers, and that they
will convey to him a hint that he is under something
like a promise to furnish information, which,
as regards Dr. Paget's connexion with the poet's
widow, will still be welcome.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">J. F. Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Despite his acknowledged infidelity, I must
tender my thanks to <span class="sc">Garlichithe</span> for his obliging
reference to Mr. Hunter's tract; albeit there
is, I may be permitted to suggest, no position
assumed in any note upon Milton's widow which
that tract in any way contravenes or sets aside.
The fact is, <span class="sc">Garlichithe</span>, in the outset, entirely
misapprehends the nature of my argument; and
so leads himself, by a sort of literary "Will-o-the-wisp,"
unconsciously astray.</p>

<p>It was not Randle the <i>grandfather</i> of Richard
Minshull, writer of the two letters transcribed by
Mr. Hunter, but Randle the eldest <i>son</i> of this
Richard Minshull to whom I referred as the father
of Elizabeth Milton. Nor is it <i>possible</i> that this
Elizabeth could have "died in infancy," seeing
that I possess a copy of a bond (the original is
also extant) from her brother Richard, then of
Wistaston, where he was baptized April 7, 1641,
secured to her as Elizabeth <i>Milton</i>, dated June 4,
1680.</p>

<p>As to the marriage itself, it may have taken
place in London, where the poet resided; or,
which is more probable, at or near the residence
of their mutual friend, Dr. Paget. Milton was
certainly not over-careful about ritual observances,
and it is not therefore unlikely that the rigid
Puritan preferred a private, or what is termed a
civil marriage, to one religiously and properly
conducted in the church of his forefathers.</p>

<h3>PECULIAR ORNAMENT IN CROSTHWAITE CHURCH.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. viii., p. 55.)</p>

<p>It is probable that these circles with eight radiations
are the original dedication-crosses of the
church. Such crosses are still to be seen painted
on the piers of the nave in Roman Catholic
churches. Durandus, describing the consecration
of a church, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the meanwhile within the building twelve
lamps be burning before twelve crosses, which be
depicted on the walls of the church.... Lastly, he
[the bishop] anointeth with chrism the twelve crosses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>{201}</span>
depicted on the wall."&mdash;Durandus <i>On Symbolism</i>, ed.
Neale and Webb, p. 115.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the Pontifical, <i>De Ecclesiæ Dedicatione</i>, the
rubric directs,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Item, depingantur in parietibus Ecclesiæ intrinsecùs
per circuitum duodecim cruces, circa decem palmos
super terram, videlicet tres pro quolibet, ex quatuor
parietibus. Et ad caput cujuslibet crucis figatur unus
clavus, cui affigatur una candela unius unciæ."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Dedication-crosses occur at Salisbury Cathedral,
and at Uffington Church, Berks, and in both cases
on the exterior of the buildings.</p>

<p>The crosses at Salisbury are seven in number,
viz. one over each side-door at the west end, two
on the buttresses of the north and south transepts,
two on the buttresses of the east end, and one in
the centre of the east wall. The number at Uffington
is twelve, disposed as follows: Three under
the east window, three under the west window,
one under the south window of the south transept,
one under the north window of the north
transept, one on the south wall of the nave, one
on the north wall of the nave, one on the south
wall of the chancel, and one in the east wall of
the south transept. In each case the crosses have
been of brass inlaid in the wall, with the exception
of one, which is of stone, and of more elaborate
design. The <i>rationale</i> of dedication-crosses, according
to Durandus, is,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"First, as a terror to evil spirits, that they, having
been driven forth thence, may be terrified when they
see the sign of the cross, and may not presume to enter
therein again. Secondly, as a mark of triumph; for
crosses be the banners of <span class="sc">Christ</span>, and the signs of his
triumph.... Thirdly, that such as look on them may
call to mind the passion of <span class="sc">Christ</span>, by which he hath
consecrated his Church, and their belief in his passion,"
&amp;c.&mdash;Page 125.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Under these aspects the exterior would seem the
more fitting, and may have been the original position
of them. Perhaps <span class="sc">Mr. Elliot</span> will inform us
what is the number of crosses at Crosthwaite?</p>

<h3>CURIOUS MISTRANSLATIONS.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. vi., p. 321.)</p>

<p>I have found, in <i>D'Israeli's Curiosities of Literature</i>,
two or three instances in which he mistranslates
from the French. The first occurs in the
following passage in the article headed "Inquisition:"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Once all were Turks when they were not Romanists.
Raymond, Count of Toulouse, was constrained
to submit. <i>The inhabitants were passed on the
edge of the sword</i>, without distinction of age or sex."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>From the words which I have marked for Italics,
it is clear that D'Israeli translated the passage from
some French author; but not being aware of the
idiomatic expression "passer au fil de l'épée," and
that it means "to put to the sword," he translated
the words in their literal sense, which in
English is no sense at all.</p>

<p>The second example will be found in the article
headed "Mysteries, Moralities," &amp;c. D'Israeli
quotes some extracts from the <i>Mystery of St.
Dennis</i>, and concludes with the following on the
subject of baptism:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Sire, oyez que fait ce fol prestre:</p>
    <p>Il prend de l'yaue <i>en</i> une escuelle,</p>
    <p>Et gete aux gens sur le cervele,</p>
    <p>Et dit que <i>partants</i> sont sauvés."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>which he translates thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Sir, hear what this mad priest does:</p>
    <p>He takes water <i>out of</i> a ladle,</p>
    <p>And, throwing it at people's heads,</p>
    <p>He says that <i>when they depart</i> they are saved!"</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The error of "out of" for "into" is unimportant;
but not so where he renders "partants" by
"when they depart." The word "partant," in the
original, is an adverb, and means "thereupon,"
"forthwith." This D'Israeli has mistaken for
"partant," the participle of "partir:" and hence
the erroneous construction given to the passage.</p>

<p>A third sample occurs in the same article, where
the author quotes from one of the dramas called
<i>Sotties</i>, a passage in which are these lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Tuer les gens pour leurs plaisirs,</p>
    <p><i>Jouer le leur</i>, l'autrui saisir."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>These he translates as follows:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Killing people for their pleasures,</p>
    <p><i>Minding their own interests</i>, and seizing on what belongs to another."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Here we have "jouer le leur," to gamble, rendered
by "to mind their own interests;" a rather
equivocal method, it must be confessed, of accomplishing
that object.</p>

<p>These are among the very few instances in
which D'Israeli, by quoting from the original authorities,
enables us to form an opinion as to the
correctness of his anecdotes; and when we consider
that by far the greater proportion of these
are drawn from French sources, there is reason to
apprehend that they may not have always been
given with sufficient fidelity. I am confirmed in
this view by another quotation which D'Israeli
seems to have misunderstood. He is speaking of
the feudal custom of the French barons, according
to which they were allowed to cohabit with the
new bride during the first three nights after marriage.
Upon this he remarks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Montesquieu is infinitely French when he could
turn this shameful species of tyranny into a bon mot;
for he boldly observes on this: 'C'était bien ces trois
nuits là qu'il fallait choisir; car pour les autres on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>{202}</span>
n'aurait pas donné beaucoup d'argent.' The legislator,
in the wit, forgot the feelings of his heart."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have never been able to conceive what meaning
D'Israeli could have attached to this quotation
from Montesquieu, so as to torture it into a <i>bon
mot</i>. Not only is there nothing of the kind in the
words he quotes, but there is not even an attempt
at it. The writer merely suggests a reason for the
preference given to the first three nights; and in
doing so he expresses the sentiments of the barons,
and not his own. And yet, it is upon this strange
misapprehension of Montesquieu's meaning, that
D'Israeli lays at the door of that illustrious man
the imputation of being "infinitely French," and
of forgetting, for the sake of a <i>bon mot</i>, the feelings
of his heart!</p>

<h3>"TO SPEAK IN LUTESTRING."</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. iii., p. 188.)</p>

<p>The Query on the meaning of the phrase "to
speak in lutestring," used by Philo-Junius, has
remained so long without an answer, that to attempt
to give one now seems almost to require an
apology. I will however do so. In Letter XLVII.,
dated May 28, 1771, Philo-Junius says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was led to trouble you with these observations
by a passage, which, <i>to speak in lutestring</i>, 'I met with
this morning in the course of my reading,' and upon
which I mean to put a question to the advocates for
privilege."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Now we know, that if two lutes, or other
stringed instruments, be placed near each other,
when a chord of one of them is struck, the corresponding
chord of the other will vibrate in unison,
and give a similar note; one lutestring will echo
the other. The story of the maiden who believed
that the spirit of her dead lover was near her,
because his harp sounded responsive notes to hers,
and who died heart-broken when she was undeceived,
is sufficiently well known. "To speak in
lutestring" is then to speak as another man's
echo; and Philo-Junius here was the echo of the
Duke of Grafton, and used this affected phrase
derisively, as being a favourite, or at least well-known
expression of his. In a letter which is
appended as a note to Letter XX., and which is
dated six days previous to the one just quoted,
viz. May 22, 1771, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But Junius has a great authority to support him,
which, <i>to speak with the Duke of Grafton</i>, 'I accidentally
met with this morning in the course of my
reading.' It contains an admonition which cannot be
repeated too often," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have not found the phrase "to speak in lutestring"
anywhere else; but I think, from a comparison
of these two quotations, that it must mean
what I have supposed it to mean&mdash;to speak as the
echo or exact repeater of another man's words.
Where can instances be found of the Duke of
Grafton's using this expression, which Philo-Junius
ridicules?</p>

<h3>BURIAL IN UNCONSECRATED PLACES.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. vi. <i>passim.</i>)</p>

<p>So many interesting notices have been made by
your correspondents on the subject of peculiar
interments,&mdash;skipping about from one part of the
country to another, and dropping down from the
south into Lincolnshire, as if in search of farther
instances,&mdash;that I am induced to add to the
number of records, by stating the fact as to the
late Mr. Dent, of Winterton, whose body, at his
particular request, was deposited after his death
in his own garden, on the south of the house in
Winterton, where he not only lived but died.</p>

<p>Friend Jonathan, as he was familiarly called,
was a man of shrewd understanding, and possessing
strong common sense; yet, like others, he had his
failings, and amongst them the <i>amor nummi</i> was
not the least obtrusive. As a very wealthy man he
was looked up to by a little aspiring community of
Quakers in the neighbourhood; and his own dress,
when in a better suit, exhibited an appearance of
his connexion with that fraternity.</p>

<p>The Quakers had a small burial-ground at
Thealby, in the parish of Burton-upon-Stother,
which I some years ago had the curiosity to inspect,
but such a forlorn lost place for such a sober
and serious purpose I never in my life before
looked upon; it is posited at a little distance from
the public road entering Thealby from Winterton,
where no doubt at one time stood a lot of cottages
and crofts, surrounded by common stone walls,
made from the flat stone of the neighbourhood.
But so small and so neglected was this burial
place, that I could compare it to nothing better
than an old parish pinfold; it had been so little
attended to when I visited it, that the whole area
was under a most luxuriant crop of flourishing
nettles, six or seven feet high. And as to graves,
or the purport of its occupation, we could see
nothing; and yet its position was such that with
ordinary attention it might have been even a
picturesque spot, having three or four large trees
overlooking it.</p>

<p>Upon an after inquiry I was told that a funeral
had lately taken place here, at which Friend Jonathan
was the presiding attendant. But in preparation
for this ceremony they had found so much
difficulty in stubbing up the strong nettles, and
digging the roots to form a decent grave; and
it was after all so difficult to find comfortable
standing-room about the grave, that I have ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>{203}</span>
since concluded that Mr. Dent must have been
disgusted with it, as, upon depositing their lost
friend in the earth, he, as spokesman, thought it
unnecessary to make any observations, and he
recommended that they should at once cover the
body up; and so it was done.</p>

<p>That Mr. Dent had any antipathy to the church
I do not know, but that he had a great dislike to
paying unnecessary fees I have a good recollection
of. Before his death he requested that his body
should be deposited in his own garden; and his
request was attended to by his nephew.</p>

<p>After the old gentleman's death, the present
Mr. Dent, with a praiseworthy attention, repaired
and restored in the Elizabethan style the old
dilapidated dwelling-house and homestead where
his uncle lived. And I one day paid a visit to the
grave, which is an unpretending ridge on a well-mown
grass-plat, and which, with the house and
ground, appeared to be properly attended to; and
so, I presume, it continues to be.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Wm. T. Hesleden.</span></p>

<p>J. H. M., in bringing forward Baskerville as an
example of this unusual occurrence, says, that "he
directed he should be buried under a <i>windmill</i> near
his garden." In a volume of Epitaphs, printed at
Ipswich in 1806, once the property of Archdeacon
Nares, and containing several MS. notes by him,
Baskerville's is given, with a note by the editor, in
which he is stated to have been "inurned according
to his own desire in a <i>conical building</i> near his
late widow's house." The epitaph, written by
Baskerville himself, commences with these lines&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Stranger,<br />
Beneath this <i>cone</i>, in <i>unconsecrated</i> ground,<br />
A friend to the liberties of mankind directed<br />
His body to be inurned."</p>

<p>The expression in each case, respecting the place
of his interment, seems scarcely strong enough for
us to conclude it was a <i>windmill</i>. Perhaps J. H. M.
will kindly favour me with the authority for his
statement. Nares has made the following note on
the epitaph at the bottom of the page:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I heard John Wilkes, after praising Baskerville, add,
'But he was a terrible infidel; he used to shock me!'"</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<div class="note">

<p>[At the suggestion of several correspondents we have
reprinted from <i>The Athenæum</i> of the 22nd Nov. 1851,
the article detailing the new process by Mr. Muller
referred to by the Rev. <span class="sc">Mr. Sisson</span> in our last Number.]</p>

</div>

<p><i>Mr. Muller's Process.</i>&mdash;"The following photographic
process has been communicated to us by
Mr. C. J. Muller, from Patna in the East Indies.
We have submitted it to an experienced photographer;
and he informs us that it offers many
advantages over the Talbotype or the Catalissotype
of Dr. Woods, which it somewhat resembles;
that it is easy in all its manipulatory details, and
certain in its results. We give Mr. Muller's own
words&mdash;</p>

<p>"'A solution of hydriodate of iron is made in
the proportion of eight or ten grains of iodide of
iron to one ounce of water. This solution I prepare
in the ordinary way with iodine, iron-turnings,
and water.&mdash;The ordinary paper employed in photography
is dressed on one side with a solution of
nitrate of lead (fifteen grains of the salt to an
ounce of water). When dry, this paper is iodized
either by immersing it completely in the solution
of the hydriodate of iron, or by floating the leaded
surface on the solution. It is removed after the
lapse of a minute or two, and lightly dried with
blotting-paper. This paper now contains iodide
of lead and protonitrate of iron. While still moist,
it is rendered sensitive by a solution of nitrate of
silver (one hundred grains to the ounce) and
placed in the camera. After an exposure of the
duration generally required for Talbot's paper, it
may be removed to a dark room. If the image is
not already out, it will be found speedily to appear
in great strength and with beautiful sharpness
<i>without any farther application</i>. The yellow
tinge of the lights may be removed by a little
hyposulphite of soda, though simple washing in
water seems to be sufficient to fix the picture.
The nitrate of lead nay be omitted; and plain
paper only, treated with the solution of the hydriodate
of iron, and acetic acid may be used with the
nitrate of silver, which renders it more sensitive.
The lead, however, imparts a peculiar colorific effect.
The red tinge brought about by the lead may be
changed to a black one by the use of a dilute solution
of sulphate of iron:&mdash;by which, indeed, the
latent image may be very quickly developed. The
papers however will not keep after being iodized.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Muller suggests, that as iodide of lead is
completely soluble in nitrate of silver, it might
furnish a valuable photographic fluid, which could
be applied at any moment when required.</p>

<p>"No small degree of interest attaches to this
process, originating in experiments carried on in
Central India. It appears perfectly applicable to
the albumenized glass and collodion processes."</p>

<p><i>Detail on Negative Paper.</i>&mdash;I have not observed
before this, that any photographic operator has
"noted" the burnishing of the iodised paper
previous to adding the exciting solution, though
I know it is usual to burnish before taking a proof.
This is a very useful adjunct to obtaining minuteness,
and it is a plan I have sometimes adopted. I
at first thought it would injure or knock off the
iodized surface, but no injury whatever arises
from the rubbing. I use a small piece of glass
rod, polished flat at one end, so that it may present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>{204}</span>
a facet about half an inch square; but I should
imagine a better instrument might be manufactured
with a proper handle, and some mode of obtaining
pressure; not obtaining sufficient is the cause of
a little after-disarrangement if the nitrate of silver
is laid on with a brush, but if floated the polish
remains.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted but paper is adequate to
any detail; and when a paper shall be manufactured
of a perfect kind, there is no reason to suppose
but paper generally will rival collodion for
most purposes.</p>

<p>Nothing prevents it at present but the uneven
surface of paper. It is very nearly perfect in the
French negative paper; but that has so many
other drawbacks to its use that it cannot be safely
depended upon. Our manufacturers have still
some improvements to make; for if Canson Frères
had left out the blackening chemical in the paper,
it would have been better than any of ours in my
estimation.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Weld Taylor.</span></p>

<p><i>Ammonio-nitrate of Silver.</i>&mdash;Will any of your
scientific correspondents explain the chemical
cause of my inability to form the ammonio-nitrate
of silver from a solution of nitrate of silver upon
which albumenized paper has been previously
floated? Having excited some albumenized paper
on a forty-grain solution of nitrate of silver, I kept
the solution which had not been consumed for the
purpose of converting it into the ammonio-nitrate.
But on dropping in the ammonia, not only did no
precipitate take place, but the ammoniacal smell
which usually gives place to the tarry odour remained.
No albumen appeared to be dissolved
from the paper, and the solution had lost none of
its silver, which I subsequently collected by means
of having formed a chloride. This has occurred
to me more than once, and I call attention to it,
as the investigation of it may lead to some new
results.</p>

<p>"<i>Up, Guards, and at them!</i>" (Vol. v., p. 426.;
Vol. viii., pp. 111. 184.).&mdash;It will, I hope, close all
debate on this anecdote, to state that the account
I gave of it in Vol. v., p. 426., was from the Duke
himself. I thought it very unlike him to have
given his order in such a phrase, and I asked him

<p><i>German Heraldry</i> (Vol. viii., p. 150.).&mdash;Your
Querist will probably find what he inquires for in
Fursten's <i>German Arms</i>, published at Nurenberg
in folio, 1696. The plates are sometimes divided
and bound in three or four oblong volumes. The
work known as Fursten's <i>German Arms</i> was commenced
by Siebmacker, continued by Furst and
Helman, and, in 1714, by Weigel. It is often
quoted under these respective names; but of later
years, more frequently under that of Weigel's
<i>Book of German Arms</i> (Weigel Wapenbuch). It
consists of six Parts, and professes to give the
arms of the principal nobility of the Roman kingdom:
dukes, princes, princely counts; lords and
persons of position, foregone and existing, in all
the provinces and states of the German empire.

<p><i>The Eye</i> (Vol. viii., p. 25.).&mdash;I hope that interesting
question raised by your correspondent
H. C. K., respecting the term "apple of the
eye," will meet with attention from some philologist.
It might help to solve it, if it could be
discovered when the phrase first came into use
in our language. Is it possible that the word
"apple" is a corruption of the Latin "pupilla?" or
is it, according to H. C. K.'s suggestion, that the iris,
and not the pupil, is taken to represent an apple?
Doubtless your learned correspondent is aware
that in Zech. ii. 12. the Hebrew phrase is varied,
the word‎ ‏בָּבָה‎‏ being used, and occurring only in
this passage. If Gesenius's derivation of this word
be correct, which makes it to signify "the gate of
the eye," we have this idea put into a fresh shape.
Have not the Arabs a phrase, "He is dearer to
me than the <i>pupil</i> of mine eye," as well as the
other one, "The man of the eye?" Curiously
enough, the Greeks express this idea by another
word than κόρη, viz. γλήνη (<i>i. e.</i> κόρης αὐγή, the
splendour of the pupil (kin. αἴγλη), or the pupil
itself, οφθαλμου κόρη), in which the change of signification
is exactly the converse of what it is in
κόρη; viz., 1st, pupil; 2nd, a little girl; whence,
as a term of reproach, ἔῤῥε κακὴ γλήνη.</p>

referred to. I submit the following extract
from a local history:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Canute's Point was a projection of the shore near
the mouth of the Itchen, where it is supposed the celebrated
but much-embellished reproof to his courtiers
was administered; and it was preserved by a line of
piles driven into the beach, until the construction of
the docks, which effaced the old beach line. Of Canute's
Palace there are still a few remains, and the
position fully justifies the presumption of its identity."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>These piles were, I believe, in existence in the
year 1836, when the act for the construction of
the docks was obtained.</p>

<p>"The same officer of this corps (3rd dragoon
guards), who bore off the corpse of General Mansell,
relates some particulars in the action of the 24th, under
Gen. Otto:&mdash;that a man of the name of Barnes, who
had been unfortunately reduced from a serjeant to the
ranks, had bravely advanced, doing execution on the
enemy, till his retreat was foreclosed, and he was seen
engaged with five French dragoons at once; all of
these he fairly cut down, when nine more came upon
him, whom he faced and fairly kept at bay, till one of
them got behind him, and shot the brave fellow in the
head."</p>

<p>In reference to the action of the 26th, Captain
Jones observes:</p>

cavalry were engaged, and gained immortal honour."</p>

<p>The Duke of York's address to the army,
published on the 28th of April, thus concludes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"His Royal Highness has, at all times, had the
highest confidence in the courage of the British troops
in general, and he trusts that the cavalry will now be
convinced that whenever they attack with the firmness,
velocity, and order which they showed on this occasion,
no number of the enemy (we have to deal with) can
resist them."</p>

<p><i>Curious Posthumous Occurrence</i> (Vol. viii., p. 5.).&mdash;Though
the worthy grave-digger's account, reported
by A. B. C., may be chargeable with some
exaggeration as to the <i>generality</i> of body-turning,
and though the decomposing reason assigned may
not be true, yet, that many dead human bodies
are found with their faces downwards, is nevertheless
quite correct.</p>

<p>Works are now in progress, at the east end of
this metropolis, under my own immediate observation,
where this fact has been incontestably verified.
How long since, or on what occasion, these
remains of mortality were placed there, I know
not; but, in the course of excavation required for
the foundations, they are frequently met with,
and, in many instances, in this strange position.</p>

<p>I had come to the conclusion, that, during some
raging pestilence (and which may indeed again
occur, unless an acceleration takes place in our
wounded-snake-like motion in the way of sanitary
improvement), I say, it had been my impression,
that during some such awful calamity, the anxiety
of the uncontaminated to avoid infection had induced
them to remove their less fortunate fellow-creatures
out of the way with so much haste as
actually to bury them alive! and in some convulsive
struggle between life and death, they had
turned themselves over!</p>

facial bones; but, he says, very frequently the
head drops either on one side or the other&mdash;a circumstance

<p><i>Books chained to Desks in Churches</i> (Vol. viii.
p. 94.).&mdash;An engraving of a very fine perpendicular
lettern, having a book fastened to it by a
chain, is given in the <i>Proceedings of the Arch. Inst.</i>
for 1846, as existing at that time in the church of
St. Crux, York. In 1851 I noticed the upper
part of one in Chesterton Church near Cambridge,
placed on the sill of the east window of the south
aisle with a book lying upon it, very much torn
and wanting the title-page. I ascertained the
subject of it at the time; but omitted to make a
note of it, and I am sorry to say it has now slipped
my memory.</p>

<p>Rutter, in his <i>Somersetshire</i>, speaks of some old
reading desks, which were still remaining in 1829
in Wrington Church, fastened to the walls of the
chancel, on which were several books, "especially
Fox's <i>Martyrs</i>, and the <i>Clavis Bibliorum</i> of
F. Roberts, who was rector of the parish in 1675."
There was one also about the same time at Chew
Magna Church, Somersetshire; with a copy of
Bishop Jewel's <i>Defence of the Church</i> chained to
it. In Redcliff Church, Bristol, there is a small
mahogany one supported by a bracket, with a
brass chain attached, near the vestry on the north
side of the choir. Until within a very few years,
a desk, with Fox's <i>Martyrs</i> lying upon it, was in
the Holy Trinity Church, Hull, affixed to one of
the pillars in the nave.</p>

<p>A fine old Bible and chain is shown amongst the
relics at Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>

<p>It would appear that theological works were
not the only ones secured in this manner; for I
find (Rutter's <i>Somersetshire</i>, p. 258.) that one
Captain S. Sturmy of Easton in Gordano published
a folio, entitled <i>The Mariner's or Artisan's
Magazine</i>, a copy of which he gave to the parish
to be chained and locked in the desk, until any
ingenious person should borrow it, leaving 3<i>l.</i> as
a security in the hands of the trustees against
damage, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is somewhat strange that I should have
omitted the following passage whilst writing on
this subject in a recent Number, as the work
to which it refers, Bishop Jewel's <i>Defence of his
Apology for the Church of England</i>, is so well
known:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At the desire of Archbishop Parker, a copy of the
<i>Defence</i> was set up soon after Jewel's death, in almost
every parish church in England; and fragments of it
are still to be seen in some churches, together with the
chain by which it was attached to the reading-desk
provided for it."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This extract is taken from the <i>Life of Bishop
Jewel</i>, prefixed to the English translation of the
<i>Apology</i>, edited by Dr. Jelf for the Society for
promoting Christian Knowledge (8vo. Lond. 1849),

<p>An order for the setting up of "the <i>Paraphrases</i>

<p>In Malvern Abbey Church is a stand to which
two books are chained. The one is a commentary on
the Book of Common Prayer; the other is a
treatise on Church Unity. In Kinver Church
(Worcestershire) are three books placed in a desk
(<i>not</i> chained) in the south aisle: being <i>The Whole
Duty of Man</i> (1703); <i>A Sermon made in Latine in
the Reigne of Edward the Sixte</i>, by John Jevvel,
Bishop of Sarisburie; and <i>The Actes and Monumentes

<p>At Bowness Church, on Windermere Lake,

Erasmus's <i>Paraphrase</i> chained. If I am not mistaken,
some of Jewel's works will also be found
there.</p>

<p><i>Quarrel</i> (Vol. vi., p. 172.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Balliolensis</span> will
be pleased with Mr. Trench's ingenious account of
our conversion of a <i>complaint</i> into a <i>quarrel</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Latin word (<i>querela</i>) means properly 'complaint,'
and we have in 'querulous' this its proper
meaning coming distinctly out. Not so, however, in
'quarrel,' for Englishmen, being wont not merely to
'complain,' but to set vigorously about righting and
redressing themselves, their griefs being also grievances,
out of this word, which might have given them only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>{207}</span>
'querulous' and 'querulousness,' have gotten 'quarrel'
as well."&mdash;<i>On the Study of Words</i>, p. 57.</p>

<p>"We might safely conclude," Mr. Trench premises,
"that a nation would not be likely tamely to submit
to tyranny and wrong, which made 'quarrel' out of
'querela.'"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This, I say, is very ingenious, but did <i>this</i> nation
make <i>quarrel</i> out of <i>querela</i>? Did they not take
it ready made from their neighbours, the French,
Italian, Spanish, who have all performed, and, I
presume, led the way in performing, the same
exploit; showing that they must all have had the
same disposition inhering in them to set about
righting and redressing themselves, though not
always, perhaps, with so prompt and active a
vigour as that ascribed to the English by Mr.
Trench.</p>

<p><i>Burial on the North Side of Churches</i> (Vol. vi.,
p. 112. &amp;c.).&mdash;The opinion of your correspondent
<span class="sc">Seleucus</span>, that the avoidance of burial on the
north side of a churchyard is to be attributed to
its being generally the unfrequented side of the
church, is borne out by the fact, that in the rare
cases where the entrance to the church is <i>only</i> on
the north side, the graves are also to be found
there in preference to being on the south, which
in such a case would of course be "the back of
the church." <span class="sc">Seleucus</span> mentions one instance of
a church entered only from the north. To this
example may be added the little village church
of Martin Hussingtree, between Worcester and
Droitwich, where the sole entrance is on the
north, and where <i>all</i> the burials are on the same
side of the church.</p>

<p><i>Rubrical Query</i> (Vol. vii., p. 247.).&mdash;The contradiction

Both are to be closely construed. The <i>first</i> enjoins
notice to be given of Communion as of any other
festival; the <i>second</i> provides that in the same service
(notice having been so given) the Exhortation
shall be the last impression on the thoughts of the

<p><i>Stone Pillar Worship</i> (Vol. vii., p. 383.).&mdash;The
Rowley Hills near Dudley, twelve in number, and
each bearing a distinctive name, make up what
may be called a mountain of basaltic rock, which
extends for several miles in the direction of Hales
Owen. From the face of a precipitous termination
of the southern extremity of these hills rises
a pillar of rock, known as the "The Hail Stone."
I conjecture that the word <i>hail</i> may be a corruption
of the archaic word <i>haly</i>, holy; and that this
pillar of rock may have been the object of religious
worship in ancient times. The name may have
been derived directly front the Anglo-Saxon <i>Haleg
stan</i>, holy stone. It is about three quarters of a
mile distant from an ancient highway called
"The Portway," which is supposed to be of British
origin, and to have led to the salt springs at
Droitwich. I have no knowledge of any other
place bearing the name of Hail Stone, except a
farm in the parish of West Fetton in Shropshire,
which is called "The Hail Stones." No stone
pillars are now to be found upon it: there is a
quarry in it which shows that the sand rock lies
there very near the surface. Dr. Plot, in his
<i>History of Staffordshire</i> (p. 170.), describes the
rock on the Rowley Hills as being "as big and as
high on one side as many church steeples are."
He relates that he visited the spot in the year
1680, accompanied by a land-surveyor, who, ten
years before that time, had noticed that at this
place the needle of the compass was turned six
degrees from its due position. The influence
which the iron in basaltic rocks has on the needle
was not known at that period, and the Doctor
makes two conjectures in explanation of the phenomenon
observed. First, he says, "there must
be in these lands that miracle of Nature we call a
loadstone;" and he adds, "unless it come to pass
by some old armour buried hereabout in the late
civil war." The sonorous property of the rock led
him to conjecture "that there might be here a
vault in which some great person of ancient times
might be buried under this natural monument;
but digging down by it as near as I could where
the sound directed, I could find no such matter."</p>

<p>Plot does not mention the name by which this
rock was known. It is not mentioned at all by
either Erdeswick, Shaw, or Pitt, in their Histories
of Staffordshire.</p>

<p><i>Bad</i> (Vol. vi. p. 509.).&mdash;Horne Tooke's etymology
may, perhaps, satisfy <span class="sc">B. H. Cowper's</span> inquiry,
or at least gratify his curiosity. He assumes
the <i>bay</i> or bark of a dog to be excited by
what it <i>abhors</i>, <i>hates</i>, <i>defies</i>; and farther, that our
epithet of <i>bad</i> is applied by us to that, which, for
reasons which we may call moral (<i>æsthetic</i>, I believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>{208}</span>
I ought to say) reasons or feelings, we <i>hate</i>,
or <i>abhor</i>. And he forms it thus, <i>bay-ed</i>, bay'd,
ba'd, <i>bad</i>.</p>

the usage by Hammond (in Johnson) that the

to frighten into a snare, and thus, to ensnare.
And the noun, a snare, allurement, temptation.</p>

<p><i>Praying to the West</i> (Vol. viii., p. 102.).&mdash;<i>The
isles of the West</i>, by which is understood what we
term the British Isles, in the ancient Hindoo
writings are described as <i>the Sacred Isles</i>, or the
abode of religion. The Celtic tribes used the
practice of turning to the West in their religious
rites, having adopted it in a very early age from
a reason similar to that which led the <i>Turks</i> in a
later age to turn towards Mecca, and <i>other nations</i>
towards the East; that is, the superior sanctity
attached by each to these several points. This
practice the Celtic tribes brought with them in
their migration from the East to those parts in
which we now find it in the West; where it has
been retained by their descendants after the circumstances
which gave rise to it had been long
forgotten.</p>

<p><i>Gibbon's Library</i> (Vol. vii., p. 407.)&mdash;<i>West's

hundred of Gibbon's books were in the library of

who bought them at Lausanne. Among

<p><i>Derivation of "Island"</i> (Vol. viii., p. 49.).&mdash;H. C. K.'s
derivation of <i>island</i> from <i>eye</i>, the visual orb,
because each are surrounded by water, seems to
me so like a banter on etymologists, that I am
doubtful whether I ought to notice it; but as our
Editor seems, by the space he has given it, to take
it as serious, I shall venture to say two or three
words upon it. H. C. K. begins by begging the
question: he says that "the etymon from the Fr.
<i>isle</i>, It. <i>isola</i>, Lat. <i>insula</i>, is <i>manifestly erroneous</i>."
Now I think I can prove&mdash;and that by a single
word&mdash;that it is "manifestly" the true one. I
only reverse his order of placing these words; they
should stand, the mother first, the children after;
<i>insula</i> Lat., <i>isola</i> It., <i>isle</i> Fr., and to them I add
my <i>single word</i>, which H. C. K. has chosen to
ignore altogether, <i>isle</i> English; as, <i>Isle</i> of Wight,
<i>Isle</i> of Man, <i>Isle</i> of Thanet, <i>Isles</i> of Arran, &amp;c.
This single word, thus supplied, is to my mind a
sufficient answer to H. C. K.'s theory, but I may
add, as a corroboration, the peculiarity of retaining
in <i>spelling</i>, and dropping in <i>pronunciation</i>, the
<i>s</i> in the English <i>isle</i> and <i>island</i>, just as it is in the
French <i>isle</i> and <i>islot</i>. Indeed the relation between
the French and English words is, in this case, not
<i>derivation</i> but <i>identity</i>. I may also observe that
the Scotch and Irish names for an island, <i>inch</i>, <i>innis</i>,
<i>ennis</i>&mdash;as, <i>Inch</i>-keith, <i>Innis</i>-fallen, <i>Ennis</i>-killen&mdash;are
"manifestly" derived from <i>insula</i>, the common
parent of all. I half suspect that H. C. K.
is a wag, and meant to try whether we should take
seriously what he meant as <i>all my eye</i>!</p>

the pulpit of Shelsley Beauchamp Church, Worcestershire,
until the restoration of the church, about
eight years ago, by the present rector, the Rev.
D. Melville, who carefully preserved the hour-glass
relic. In order to show how much had been
done for the church, I drew interior and exterior
views of the old building, with its great dilapidations
and unusually monstrous disfigurements,
which drawings were hung in the vestry, at the
suggestion of the rector, as parish memorials; a
proceeding which I think might be copied with
advantage in all cases of church restoration. In
the one drawing mentioned the hour-glass stand
is a conspicuous object.</p>

They are not very uncommon; they generally stand
on the right-hand of the pulpit, and are made of iron.
Examples Coton, Shepreth. A curious revolving
one occurs at Stoke D'Abernon, Surrey, and in St. John
Baptist, Bristol, where the hour-glass itself remains.
Though a Puritanick innovation, it long kept its place:
for Gay in his <i>Pastorals</i> writes:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>'He said that Heaven would take her soul no doubt,</p>

<p><i>Impossibilities of History</i> (Vol. viii., p. 72.).&mdash;St.
Bernard, according to Gibbon, lived from 1091
to 1153. Henry I., who did rebel against his
father, was twelve years older than the Saint, and
ascended the throne at the age of twenty-one in
the year 1100, when the Saint was nine years old.
The descent from the devil alludes, I should think,
to Robert le Diable, the father of the Conqueror.
The historian of <i>The Tablet</i> found the authority
most probably in some theatrical review or fly-leaf

may correlate with the Gr. ἀγωγὸς, a leader, so
familiar to us in the sneered at pæd-<i>agogue</i>, <i>i. e.</i>
the boy-<i>leader</i>. The <i>lad</i>, from the Anglo-Saxon
<i>lædian</i>, to lead (says Junius), is the <i>leăd</i>&mdash;"One

<p><i>Enough</i> (Vol. vii., p. 455.).&mdash;Enough was not,
and is not always, nor was it originally, pronounced
<i>enuf</i>. The old way of writing was
"ynou, inouh, ynowgh;" and in Gower, <i>enough</i> is
made to rhyme with <i>slough</i>, i. e. <i>slow</i> or <i>slew</i>, the
past tense of <i>slay</i>. <span class="sc">Mr. Wright</span> will find this to
be so by looking into Richardson's quotations.
The word, he will see also, was from very early
times written, as still not unfrequently pronounced,
<i>enew</i> or <i>enow</i>.</p>

<p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the
most excellent, nourishing, and restorative
remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful
in confined habit of body, as also diarrhœa,
bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory
irritation and cramp of the urethra, cramp of
the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and hemorrhoids.
This really invaluable remedy is employed
with the most satisfactory result, not
only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
where irritation and pain are to be removed,
but also in pulmonary and bronchial consumption,
in which it counteracts effectually the
troublesome cough; and I am enabled with
perfect truth to express the conviction that Du
Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted to the
cure of incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>

<p>SOME ACCOUNT of DOMESTIC
ARCHITECTURE in ENGLAND,
from the Conquest to the end of the thirteenth
Century, with numerous Illustrations of Existing
Remains from Original Drawings. By
T. HUDSON TURNER.</p>

<p>"What Horace Walpole attempted, and what
Sir Charles Lock Eastlake has done for oil-painting&mdash;elucidated
its history and traced its
progress in England by means of the records
of expenses and mandates of the successive
Sovereigns of the realm&mdash;Mr. Hudson Turner
has now achieved for Domestic Architecture in
this country during the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries."&mdash;<i>Architect.</i></p>

<p>"The writer of the present volume ranks
among the most intelligent of the craft, and
a careful perusal of its contents will convince
the reader of the enormous amount of labour
bestowed on its minutest details, as well as the
discriminating judgment presiding over the
general arrangement."&mdash;<i>Morning Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"The book of which the title is given above
is one of the very few attempts that have been
made in this country to treat this interesting
subject in anything more than a superficial
manner.</p>

<p>"Mr. Turner exhibits much learning and
research, and he has consequently laid before
the reader much interesting information. It
is a book that was wanted, and that affords us
some relief from the mass of works on Ecclesiastical
Architecture with which of late years
we have been deluged.</p>

<p>"The work is well illustrated throughout
with wood-engravings of the more interesting

<p>THE DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE
OF THE MIDDLE AGES.
Vol. II.&mdash;THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY.
By the Editor of "The Glossary of Architecture."</p>

<p>This volume is issued on the plan adopted by
the late Mr. Hudson Turner in the previous
volume: viz., collecting matter relating to
Domestic buildings of the Period, from contemporary
records, and applying the information
so acquired to the existing remains.</p>

<p>Not only does the volume contain much
curious information both as to the buildings
and manners and customs of the time, but it is
also hoped that the large collection of careful
Engravings of the finest examples will prove as
serviceable to the profession and their employers
in building mansions, as the Glossary
was found to be in building churches.</p>

<p>The Text is interspersed throughout with
numerous woodcuts.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
